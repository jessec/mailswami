        <p>Last year alone, we received over 600 billion emails from spammers.</p>

<p>Accessing your mailbox is always a challenge. Marketers may find mailbox providers too strict, but for a good reason. Many bad emails are sent. Last year alone, we received over 600 billion emails from spammers.</p>

<p>Mailbox providers have these strict protocols to block legitimate senders and keep spammers and harmful content out of your inbox. Mailbox providers evaluate the reputation of recipients when deciding which emails to allow or block inboxes to distinguish “good” from “bad.” Sender reputation is calculated using various statistics, and each mailbox provider has formulas that determine whether to accept incoming mail and where to filter it.</p>

<p>Marketers strive to use the return path sender score to detect and track sender reputations in their inbox and learn how mailbox providers display messages. Like credit ratings, sender scores evaluate how you send to other senders to determine the quality of your messages and email programs. A number between 0 and 100 represents marketer sender scores. The sender’s score accurately describes how the email is viewed, using the same data points and reputation formulas that mailbox providers use.</p>

<p>This report looks at several factors, including both sender scores and mailbox provider reputation calculations. We’ll also look at how these items affect the reputation of shipping and how reputation affects deliverability.</p>
