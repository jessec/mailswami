&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about Gmail is that when you send an email from your Gmail address (e.g. name@gmail.com), your Google account profile picture will appear next to your email address. However, you won’t see the Google Account profile picture when sending email using Gmail from a non-Gmail domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m specifically talking about different email addresses set under “Send email as” in the “Accounts” and “Gmail import” settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example like name@yourcompany.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yourname@gmail.com &amp;lt;- Profile picture is displayed. 
name@yourcompany.com &amp;lt;- Profile picture is not displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about boring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is the character?
If you get your branding right, you’ll want to be consistent across all social media channels, including Gmail. Sure, you might have a great custom signature line, but it shouldn’t end there.

&lt;p&gt;“What’s my profile picture in my Google Account?” You asked?
This:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can completely modify this photo if you wish.
Here’s how to view your Google Account profile picture when sending email from a non-Gmail domain. Follow these steps to view your Google Gmail account profile picture when sending email from a non-Gmail domain. Example: Your domain is yourcompany.com and you can use Gmail to send email to name@yourcompany.com.
This is a quick and easy five-click process. It shouldn’t take more than three minutes. (Four or five cases for alcohol consumption or lack of sleep. Six minutes for both)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On your desktop / laptop, go to https://myaccount.google.com (or in Gmail, click your profile picture in the top right corner of the page, then click My Account).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the left side of the page, click Personal Information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under CONTACT INFO, click on the arrow to the right of the email. Scroll down to a different email address.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add your new / alternate / company to the alternate email cell. Note: If you can’t see the Alternate Email tab, you may need to click the Advanced button. There should be a “Legacy Email” section.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you need to add all the email to your domain that you want to send from and view your Google account profile. Such as name@yourcompany.com.
You have to confirm the new email address by sending a confirmation email to the email address you added as an alternate email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check the new “Alternative” email when it hits your inbox. Do not skip this step as your profile picture will not appear until you do this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test, send an email to anyone with a Gmail email address. You should see your profile photo next to your name.
Like him:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessing your mailbox is always a challenge. Marketers may find mailbox providers too strict, but for a good reason. Many bad emails are sent. Last year alone, we received over 600 billion emails from spammers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mailbox providers have these strict protocols to block legitimate senders and keep spammers and harmful content out of your inbox. Mailbox providers evaluate the reputation of recipients when deciding which emails to allow or block inboxes to distinguish “good” from “bad.” Sender reputation is calculated using various statistics, and each mailbox provider has formulas that determine whether to accept incoming mail and where to filter it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketers strive to use the return path sender score to detect and track sender reputations in their inbox and learn how mailbox providers display messages. Like credit ratings, sender scores evaluate how you send to other senders to determine the quality of your messages and email programs. A number between 0 and 100 represents marketer sender scores. The sender’s score accurately describes how the email is viewed, using the same data points and reputation formulas that mailbox providers use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report looks at several factors, including both sender scores and mailbox provider reputation calculations. We’ll also look at how these items affect the reputation of shipping and how reputation affects deliverability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="article" /><category term="news" /><summary type="html">Last year alone, we received over 600 billion emails from spammers.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Warm Up Your Cold Email List and Increase Deliverability</title><link href="/article/news/how-to-warmup-your-cold-email-list.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Warm Up Your Cold Email List and Increase Deliverability" /><published>2021-09-24T17:39:18+07:00</published><updated>2021-09-24T17:39:18+07:00</updated><id>/article/news/how-to-warmup-your-cold-email-list</id><content type="html" xml:base="/article/news/how-to-warmup-your-cold-email-list.html">&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Why Cold Emails Fail &amp;amp; The Dos and Don’ts of Sending an Effective Cold Email&lt;/p&gt;
