                    <p>There are plenty of guides about email deliverability, we know it.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, we find that most of them keep saying the same obvious advices and&nbsp;<strong>don&rsquo;t give the most effective techniques.</strong></p>
                    <p>This guide comes from&nbsp;<strong>5 years of intensive cold emailing&nbsp;</strong>for more than<strong>&nbsp;130 companies in 40 industries.</strong></p>
                    <p>The guidelines we deliver in this guide are the ones we used to :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grow from&nbsp;<strong>0&euro; to 120k&euro; Monthly Recurring Revenue in 6 months</strong>&nbsp;with cold emailing as our only acquisition channel in our previous company.</li>
                        <li>Help raise&nbsp;<strong>56M&euro; in funding for IPOs and seed rounds with cold emails.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Get 75% open rate&nbsp;</strong>on average on our cold email campaigns.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Of course, as the rules change regularly so we&rsquo;re going to update this guide as often as necessary.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>We hope you&rsquo;re going to find&nbsp;<strong>really helpful tips to improve your email results</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
